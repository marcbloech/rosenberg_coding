    "### Values\n",
    "**Values** are simply text or numbers, such as \"Hello world\" and 42.\n",
    "We learned that there are different **types** of values in Python, called\n",
    "- **Strings** for text like \"Hello World\" (because the single letters are \"strung\" together to form the strings)\n",
    "- **Integers**, which are whole numbers like 10 and 42, short called \"int\"\n",
    "- **Floats**, which are numbers that have a decimal point such as 2.5 and 44.999 (they are called \"floating point numbers\", \"float\" is shorter)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see what type a certain value is by using the function \"type()\". Sometimes, it is important to know which type you are using because some functions only work with some types, but not with others. For example, we cannot divide text, only integers and floats.\n",
